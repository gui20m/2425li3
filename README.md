# 2425li3 Project

Welcome to the **2425li3** project repository! This project was developed as part of the **LI3 (Laboratorios Informatica 3 UMinho)** course for the academic year **2425**. It represents the culmination of our efforts, learnings, and dedication throughout the course.

## About the Project

This project was designed to meet the requirements and challenges set forth by the LI3 course. It showcases our understanding of key concepts, problem-solving skills, and ability to work collaboratively on complex tasks. Whether it's algorithms, data structures, or software design, this project reflects the knowledge we've gained during the year.

## Disclaimer

Please note that this project was created exclusively for academic purposes and as part of the LI3 course curriculum. **No ongoing support or maintenance will be provided for this codebase.** It is shared here for reference, inspiration, or educational use, but it is not intended for production or further development.

## Acknowledgments

One of the main objectives of this project was to develop and apply the concepts of **modularity** and **encapsulation** in software design. We are proud to say that this goal was successfully achieved, as demonstrated by the structure and organization of the codebase.
